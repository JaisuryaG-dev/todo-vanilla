# todo-vanilla
This is a simple Todo list web app built without any frameworks â€” just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It lets you add, complete, and delete tasks, with data saved locally in your browser using localStorage. Perfect as a beginner-friendly mini project to learn Git, GitHub Desktop, and basic front-end development.
